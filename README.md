# Diskwarn

Simple program that adds a `DISK` warning in red to your shell prompt if you have less than 1GB left in your home directory. It assumes your home directory is a partition which probably isn't normally the case but it is for me.

Just compile and add `$(/path/to/diskwarn)` to your `PS1`.
